# To-Do

# High Priority

- [ ] Keyspace `remove` does not work in MQL.
- [ ] Document `remove` does not work in MQL. (`Query execution failed: Execution error: Invalid operation: no key for delete`)
- [ ] `use <namespace>` does not verify namespace existence.
- [ ] Update the GUI and REPL to support authentication.
- [ ] When connecting with TLS to server without TLS, the client sends a lot of data and never closes the connection.
- [ ] Ctrl+Enter doesn't execute current query, just picks a random one.
- [ ] Export formats aren't implemented in the GUI.
